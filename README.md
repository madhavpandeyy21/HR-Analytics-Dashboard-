📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Power BI
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze employee attrition, salary structure, workforce distribution, and resignation trends.

The dashboard helps HR and management teams make data-driven decisions to reduce attrition and optimize workforce planning.

🚨 Problem Statement

Organizations often struggle to understand:

Why employees are leaving the company

Which departments have the highest attrition

Whether salary structure impacts resignations

Gender distribution imbalance

Job roles most affected by turnover

Without proper analytics, HR decisions are often reactive rather than strategic.

The objective of this project was to analyze historical employee data and build an interactive dashboard that provides:

Clear visibility into attrition trends

Department-wise and job role-wise resignation insights

Salary distribution analysis

Gender-based workforce analysis

Actionable business recommendations

🎯 Objectives

Calculate overall attrition rate

Identify departments with highest resignations

Analyze resignation reasons
